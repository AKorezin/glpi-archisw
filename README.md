GLPI plugin for application inventory.<br/>
An application can be decomposed in different sofware components. An application is then the root of a tree with 1 to several levels of software components.<br/>
For each sotware component, you can maintain its status (In development, in production, ... ), its main technologies (language, DB), its editor and supplier, ... <br/>
You can associate these software components with other inventory elements (servers, databases, dataflows, ...)
